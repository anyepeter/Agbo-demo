        description: `St Joseph's College Sasse was founded in 1939 by the Mill Hill Missionaries. It has since become a cradle of academic excellence in Cameroon. This is the oldest college in Cameroon. The 33rd annual SOBA America convention was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, famously known as the Queen City. Aside from being home to the renowned NASCAR competition, Charlotte boasts a rich culture, delightful cuisine, exciting entertainment, thrilling adventures, and some of the friendliest people in the country. Similar to last year, the convention adopted a cashless approach, meaning that no cash transactions were accepted throughout the entire process, starting from pre-convention registration to on-site purchases. Various electronic payment methods were made available to SOBANS and attendees. This cashless system not only provided a safer environment and also facilitated a smoother payment process. Furthermore, it enhanced transparency and accountability. Thanks to these measures, the financial team is well-positioned to deliver a timely financial report, with only a few pending items such as the final hotel bill and some vendor invoices.`,

He wanted to offer education for girls, especially at a period when female education was not a priority. Upon completion of a school building in 1963, he asked Bishop Peeters, the Catholic Bishop of West Cameroon, permission to open the school. St. Joseph's Parish, Mankon generously donated a building and the establishment was named and entrusted into the care of Our Lady of Lourdes. The school opened its doors on 15 October 1963. Our Lady of Lourdes College joined Saker Baptist College and Queen of the Rosary College, Okoyong, as the only all-girls secondary schools in Cameroon. Throughout the years Our Lady of Lourdes College has expanded with new buildings, facilities, and programs serving about seven hundred students. The association of ex-students (or alumni) is known as the Lourdes Ex-Students Association (LESA) and ex-students are called LESANs.",
